# TODO

### Skills

- [ ] Add popover to the hover state of the skills items to briefly discuss what exactly each skill was used for
- [ ] Add tags / lists of technologies used in the tool chain for a project (Unity, Visual Studio, DirectX, etc).
It would be nice to highlight these along side the skill hover
- [ ] Make the skills element load from an external file so it's easier to edit and can hold more complex info
- [ ] "Design" Skills should use cool colors, while "technical" should use warm colors

Menu updates "focused" project as the screen scrolls
