[JH APL Uses ProtoSpace](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Show-Article.php?articleID=36) _JHAPL_

ProtoSpace on the Microsoft Hololens is a tool for accurately visualizing mechanical engineering spacecraft CAD models at full scale. It enables both local and remote collaboration between headsets. By allowing engineers to inspect and discuss design decisions and procedures before hardware is developed, ProtoSpace can help save costs on both mockups and preventable mistakes.

ProtoSpace is modeled as a service application being built up of a variety of components including a web application for processing models, a processing pipeline to convert complex CAD models, and the collaborative hololens client.

**TODO: The "vision"? Research process? Success stories?**
