ProtoSpace on the Microsoft Hololens is a tool for accurately visualizing mechanical engineering spacecraft CAD models at full scale. It enables both local and remote collaboration between headsets. By allowing engineers to inspect and discuss design decisions and procedures before hardware is developed, ProtoSpace can help save costs on both mockups and preventable mistakes.
