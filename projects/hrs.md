Research task to explore new opportunities and investigate innovative approaches to solving difficult problems in spacecraft operations. Tasks included tools to mitigate the negative effects of time delay in rover operations, intuitively operating high-degree-of-freedom robots such as Robonaut and ATHLETE, and visualizing spacecraft imagery with immersive technologies.
