# Me

##### Interaction Designer, Developer
##### NASA JPL
##### UCLA 2012, Game Design & Development (Independent Major)

I've been in LA since 2008 and at NASA JPL since 2012 researching, designing, and building tools for the future of spacecraft design and operation with modern AR, VR, and web technologies.

At UCLA I created an independent major that focused on the intersection of design creativity and technical capability with a mix of classes from the design, animation, math, and computer science departments.
I continue grow and bring expertise in both the technical and design domains with a passion for problems that sit at the intersection of the two.
