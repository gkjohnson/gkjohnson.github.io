We put a Microsoft Hololens on the International Space Station and researched applications for augmenting astronaut procedures with spatial cues. Astronaut Scott Kelly used the device for real-time communication with ground operators.

#### Prototyping
This project in particular held a number of interesting design problems. Our target audience worked on the International Space Station, an environment with no proper "up", working with very complex, hardware-specific procedures -- the experts of which were several states away in Houston, Texas -- and we wanted to be able to design and iterate quickly for an augmented reality platform during our short time with the primary user.

We started with basic paper prototypes and technical prototypes using tasks with similar problems that our astronauts might face, such as reconnecting an unfamiliar circuit. We also built an mockup of a piece of the ISS out of gorilla board in our lab to give us the feeling for a problem with a larger scale.

#### Meeting with the Astronauts

We took our prototypes to JSC to talk to a variety of astronauts and get feedback, as well as run evaluations in their training facilities using both our paper concepts, technical prototype, and a Holographic version of Skype. Our evaluations involved both the training facility for an ISS docking hatch and a mockup of the Microgravity Science Glovebox.

After losing the the first set of devices in a launch failure, two devices made it to the ISS in December 2015 and [a checkout was made with Astronaut Scott Kelley in February 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGoV9mTic4I).
