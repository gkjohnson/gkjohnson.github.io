Investigated, designed, and developed prototype platform for the next generation of spacecraft visualization and operation using the JPL ATHLETE robot as a model mission. We produced web-based sequence editors and 3d visualization tools, as well as intuitive 3d interfaces for visually building and playing-back sequences.
