The Integrated Model Environment is a modular spacecraft analysis and design tool based in MBSE concepts built to replace an existing Excel-based tool suite. Itâ€™s designed for iterative real-time collaborative use in time-constrained design sessions of about 3 hours.

#### Research
The JPL Innovation Foundry is resposible for churning out and validating creative mission concepts -- all the way from blue sky, sticky note idea phase to spacecraft point design and cost analysis, and finally to developing funding proposals for those designs.
As someone with no background in aerospace or spacecraft development, taking the time to wrap my head around the problem was a must.

The bulk of the understanding came from working closely with our potential users and domain experts to fully grasp what happens when during these hectic collaborative 3-hour design sessions and where the current Excel paradigm is limiting. We observed these sessions, dissected their existing tooling, and made a variety of storyboards paper prototypes to circle back and validate our understanding with our users and bring the rest of the team onto the same page.

#### Design & Prototyping
A lot of the existing approaches to building modular, MBSE analyses revolve around building models with blocks and lines connecting their inputs and outputs, as with the tools _Model Center_ and _Magic Draw_. A lot of sacrifices are made to information availabilty, visual simplicity, and speed to accomodate that approach, though. We wanted _IME_ to have a simple layout with a focus on what engineers really needed to be thinking about in the three hours: the analysis information and the hardware.

To explore the design space, we looked at existing solutions and iterated on different ways to lay out the information -- involving our users and expertise whenever we had questions. Our designs culminated in a simple, technical prototype that demonstrated the types of information, analyses, and web-based tooling we hoped to offer, which ultimately drove our vision moving forward to production.
